🔬 Cervical Cancer Diagnostic AI
Automated Cytopathology Classification using Deep Learning
👩‍💻 Project Team
Lead Engineer: Theresa Mapfumo
Institution: Harare Institute of Technology (HIT)
Department: Biomedical Engineering
📌 Project Overview
This application leverages a ResNet-34 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify microscopic cervical cell images into four diagnostic levels. The system is designed to assist pathologists by providing a rapid second opinion on cellular morphology.

📊 Model Performance
Architecture: ResNet-34 (Transfer Learning)
Dataset: SIPaKMeD (Superficial, Intermediate, Parabasal, Koilocytotic, and Metaplastic cells)
Validation Accuracy: 97.8%
🧬 Diagnostic Mapping
Level	Clinical Classification	Cell Type
Level 0	Normal	Superficial-Intermediate / Parabasal
Level 1	Benign	Metaplastic
Level 2	Low-Grade (LSIL)	Koilocytotic
Level 3	High-Grade (HSIL)	Dyskeratotic
🚀 Deployment Instructions (Hugging Face Spaces)
This project is optimized for Hugging Face Spaces using the Gradio SDK for a stable, high-performance web interface.

1. Repository Requirements
Ensure the following files are uploaded to your Hugging Face Space:

app.py: The Gradio interface logic.
requirements.txt: Contains fastai.
cervix_levels_model.pkl: The exported learner file.
2. Online Setup
Create a new Space on Hugging Face.
Select Gradio as the SDK.
Upload the files listed above via the "Files and versions" tab.
The app will automatically build and go live at your Space URL.
🎨 Frontend Creative Brief
Note to the Lead Engineer: The AI "Engine" is fully integrated. You have creative control over the Gradio interface to make it look like a professional medical diagnostic tool.

Recommended Enhancements:

Custom Theming: Use theme="soft" or "glass" in app.py to match medical software aesthetics.
Interpretation Guide: Add a Markdown section below the interface explaining the clinical significance of each Level (0-3).
Example Gallery: Add a folder of "Test Images" so users can demonstrate the AI's accuracy instantly without needing their own files.
Confidence Visualization: Ensure the gr.Label component is showing the top 3 classes to reflect the model's "thinking" process.
